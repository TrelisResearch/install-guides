      "we are here live in Omaha Nebraska good morning everybody I'm Becky quick along with Mike santoli and in just 30 minutes time Berkshire Hathaway chairman and CEO Warren Buffett's going to be taking the stage with his vice chair Charlie Munger the legendary duo will also be joined by berkshire's two other Vice chairs Greg Abel who manages the non-insurance operations for the company and Ajit Jain who runs all of the insurance businesses and as always it's pretty big crowd here lots and lots of people and a few people you might notice too Tim Cook is here Apple of course is still berkshire's largest holding big big part of its portfolio there you see him backstage getting ready to go out and take his seat he gets to sit down in the special seats by the way that's Debbie pasonic Warren's assistant who's standing by just went bite beside him also in the crowd Bill Murray he has been here for a couple of days been hanging around you can check out he is taking a seat right now too some other big people who are expected to be here some well-known names Jane Frazier who's the city CEO Ruth parat of alphabet she's actually here I did and see her a little earlier and by the way this was a scene just a short time ago as the Berkshire shareholders who were first in line started streaming onto the floor Mike this is like um Black Friday used to be yeah day after Thanksgiving people waiting lining up these were the doors um yeah it was a big rush they opened and everybody comes running in and it's not just because of the rain outside absolutely if it's a massive Arena Convention Center so people know and uh I don't know what time do they start lining up I looked out the window at 5 30 and I thought huh that's not as big of a crowd as I've seen in years past but then I realized it's because they changed the setup for this people used to stand about 10 Deep right at the door this year they pushed everybody the crowds down the the block because they I guess they didn't want too much of a mob scene in one place if you watched it went for blocks I didn't realize it till I went to the other side of the hotel to see it went for blocks and blocks and I've honestly never seen a line this long a lot of people around the convention center talking about how it's it's buzzier and more crowded in the exhibit all this year versus last year which was the first after the pandemic of course they broke for two years so it seems like there is a little more of a interest in uh in being here in person well they know how to time it there's a lot of news that's happening um usually you get about 40 000 people who are here this year they've been running ahead just in terms of the number of tickets that they gave out and I talked to Warren Buffett briefly last night he said that they had 6 000 people who showed up at will call yesterday to try and get last minute tickets they ran out of tickets they had to go print more to try and get people in the doors and they've never seen anything like that and as you mentioned the stuff sold out if you if you look at some of the places that are back here we're going to talk about some of these companies but he's been running the numbers and seeing what happened I I won't say too much now but he's been tabulating all of this up to see exactly what their sales are running like here versus uh years fast obviously this is sort of a weird microcosm of the of the business in the company as a whole and it's uh it's it's not Revenue neutral as he always talks about it looks you're paying you're paying to play here you are in fact it is going to be a big day here first though we should talk about the news at hand Berkshire is out with first quarter earnings and that came just moments ago Mike has been digging through all the numbers on this and there's some stories to be told here there are first of all a big swing to the upside in the overall reported earnings number uh from about five and a half billion uh dollars in the first quarter last year to 35 and a half billion but almost all that swing was the The Mark to Market on the Investment Portfolio operating earnings though is still a good story up almost 13 percent you know over a year up to about a little more than eight billion dollars um it seems like the insurance business specifically Geico swinging to a fatter underwriting profit from last year we could talk about exactly how they got there but it seems as if higher pricing less advertising Revenue they they went from margin as opposed to Pure market share it seems at this point also on the investment side uh seems like there was a reduction in the Chevron stake uh over the course of the quarter you have to back into the numbers based on the dollar value of the stakes that they give you in the share prices at the time but essentially it seems like he Berkshire was a seller of about 20 percent of that stake it's like oh that's a big six or seven billion uh dollars worth okay and um so it's still a significant holding I think it's also keep worth keeping in mind Chevron stock was up over 50 last year so simply by the market appreciating the the dollar value went up fair bit well it's interesting though if they were selling some of that steak while they were building the oxy stake uh the accident petroleum stake um not a call necessarily on oil overall just maybe picking exactly relative value or or positioning uh within that uh also Berkshire a net seller of overall Equity uh Securities in the quarter but the majority of that net reduction seems to be the Chevron I think the rest of it's hard to know Apple pretty much unchanged of course the Stock's up a lot but the position is unchanged uh Bank of America also seems unchanged too so those are two not a lot of change in terms of the key core holder for Bank of America that's the one bank that he has kept he sold out of a handful of other Banks Banks some of them that he's held for a very long time so Bank of America still seems to be his favorite maybe we'll hear more about that today you would hope yeah and just maybe General thoughts about his assessment of the banking system and uh whether it needs help whether it looks like it's an opportunity you have all these valuations that have been crushed another thing to keep in mind uh for the quarter there was four and a half billion dollars of shares bought back by Berkshire so that was up from 3.2 billion in the year ago quarter it's not an enormous number in terms of the market value of Berkshire which is 700 billion dollars it's like a you know what 18 billion dollar annual run rate of share buyback but they do reduce the outstanding shares a net reduction of shares down about 1.2 percent uh year over year so you know there were questions that came in that I've been looking through shareholder questions for a couple of months now that have been coming in on this and some of the questions that came in is do you still like Berkshire Hathaway do you still like the stock at this price are you going to be as aggressive as a buyer and I guess this answers some of that question some of it yeah it's it's absolutely not super aggressive uh but it's it's it's sort of soaking up some of the shares that are out there and of course Buffett in his shareholder letter was very vociferous about defending the practice of of being able to buy back stocks so he does it in a disciplined way he wants to be careful about why he's doing it and what the valuation is but uh clearly he's willing to use that tool oh the cash went up to 130 billion dollars so up marginally total cash holder nice Pocket Change um there had been a lot of questions that came into about the insurance company specifically Geico and you can see the gecko right now that's right shoulder uh people just wondering um what's happening and I guess we'll dig into that a little deeper today and we've got some numbers that you've been going through be very interested to hear the color on the strategy behind it because there was a little bit of uh you know an issue last year where it seemed like profitability was done now pricing is up across the industry yeah so policies are able to be written at higher prices and so that's happening across the board but it does seem you know as I say in the commentary within the the 10q that they did reduce advertising expense and it was a big swing to the upside and underwriting earnings I mean with insurance it takes a while to raise pricing for anybody in the industry because you have to go state by state and get Regulators approvals before approvals before you can actually raise any of it so there is a delay we saw some a huge hit to the profitability of all the insurers as you know prices to replace cars prices to fix things construction all of that went up right and they couldn't raise their prices as quickly exactly so it is an industry-wide phenomena but it seems as if uh Geico is trying to decide they want to skew toward more profitable customers we'll see if that's a theme that's going to continue another couple of tidbits are building products and consumers margin squeeze that's happening across the industry railroads pretty flat okay the BNSF pretty flat year over year and a pretty big reduction in consumer related Freight uh loading who needs an analyst you've already done all the work wow did the highlights I got my little you know tape bookmarks yeah that's good it works okay we have a lot more to get to this morning we want to give you a quick look at today's schedule though Mike and I are going to be here with you until 10 15 a.m eastern time that is when Buffett Munger and the vice chairman Greg Abel and Ajit Jane are going to be taking the stage you get to watch all of this the annual meeting you can see it exclusively here on CNBC and cnbc.com Buffett's going to begin the meeting with the summary of the past quarters results but like we said Mike's already done that for you so that's your bathroom break time then he's going to open the stage to shareholder questions and I'll be asking some that have been emailed into me again we've gotten lots and lots of emails this year more than I've ever seen Buffett's also going to rotate through the 11 microphone microphone positions that are in the audience too so you'll see a lot of questions being asked around 1pm Buffett will break for lunch but you get to stick around with us Mike and I will be joined right here by Berkshire board members Ron Olson and Howard Buffett we'll also be talking to Tech investor Ann widblad and Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby kodek who has been coming to this meeting for years he was here last year but had to leave early because he was going to a birthday party so he left I think at the lunch break after that is when Buffett revealed to the crowd that he had taken a stake in Activision Blizzard so Bobby found out when he was on a plane on his way back home so he's here this year too and we'll find out if there's any new news on that at the time of course it was viewed as an Arbitrage position because Activision agreed to be sold to Microsoft for cash and Buffett said it was an Arbitrage position yeah exactly the spread was very wide it seemed just like the market was leaving money on the table now that it looks like perhaps Regulators in the UK might block that deal the question is does it remain you know on a fundamental basis yeah that would be fascinating to hear the commentary on that and then at 2 p.m Eastern Buffett and Munger will be back on stage for another two and a half hours of shareholder q a after the afternoon session wraps we'll be back with you to recap all of the day's action while the Market's staging a big rally to close the week after a strong job support and revisions to the February and March employment numbers Apple a major Berkshire holding which was unchanged in the quarter a key driver for yesterday's rally the stock closing Higher by about four and a half percent uh on the day after posting better than expected earnings Apple now up nearly 34 percent so far this year here to help us navigate the current market environment and look at opportunities right now as John Rogers he's the chairman and co-ceo of aerial Investments and a long time Berkshire meeting attendee John good to see you thanks for stopping by here great to be here um what's your uh I guess what you what are you looking to hear from Mr Buffett and Munger uh both about I mean we know that the principles are going to accentuate that they always do about how they do their business and and what matters and doesn't matter in the uh in the earnings and how they approach things but what about the moment right now where it seems like there's big big questions about financial system stability whether there's value in in Bank stocks whether the economy can handle these rate hikes a couple things that I'm going to be looking for one you know when Becky interviewed Warren when he was in Asia and there was talk and Warren talked about how certain of his companies were not meeting expectations earnings were going to be less than expected and profits were lower than expected and so I want to see if that trend has continued are is he still seeing weakness in the overall economy and the second thing you know Becky followed up the question about Paramount Global and he was kind of a little bit soft and not as aggressively supporting his position as I had expected so I'm curious to see what he has to say today about it especially after the stock just located this week and you are an owner of Paramount correct we are an owner of Paramount Global assist it's not been a fun week yeah how do you feel about things I mean Paramount slashing the dividend um I I think it caught some people by surprise but Mario gabelli was here yesterday and he said it didn't catch him by surprise he wanted them to do that because he wanted them to shore up their cast position and put it back into their business at this point but I think it was the right decision and I watched Mario yesterday morning and then we did a panel and he has been very positive about the future for Paramount Global so we're still very very optimistic we think they have so many assets around the world they've got that great Paramount Library they've got Mission Impossible coming out this year all the great Sports entertainment that they have and all-time favorites like 60 minutes so I think there's more there than just the streaming and I think sometimes people are more worried than they need to be is it more there as a standalone business or do you think that this is an acquisition an acquisition Target and that I mean Mario belly has always been about you know business of Love Making with mergers and acquisitions you're right I think that everyone as we talk to experts in in the industry everyone says there's way too many streaming services we've got to get it down to three four at the maximum so I think it's very possible that Paramount Global will be bought at some point as a value manager do you look at the Carnage in things like Regional Banks and anything that seems like it's it's connected to a commercial real estate and view that as uh more of a core risk to the economic Outlook or is there actual value being being surfaced in the process well I think the stocks have gotten crushed there's a lot of pessimism and Warren often says you want to be greedy when others are fearful so I think if you're going to buy the banking stocks you'd buy a whole basket of them not try to pick one but really be Diversified we've been also adding to our favorite Northern Trust is our favorite Bank stock so I I think we're going to be okay uh it's going to be some pain and anguish here and of course commercial real estate is getting harmed and it doesn't help having the banks and the problems they are but yeah down the road we'll be fine I've been talking to folks who here in the last day and there is a little bit of suspense as to whether in fact clearly we'll get some questions on this whether uh Buffett himself sees there to be any opportunities here to provide capital in areas where it's like I mean it's worth going back to how he acquired a lot of his financial positions right American Express 60 years ago coming off a crisis that he needed Capital Bank of America clearly Solomon Brothers in the early 90s uh Goldman Sachs back around the crisis too so in other words he's been there as a source of stable Capital at times when the financial system seemed like it was in trouble would you want to see him make a move like that that would bring a lot of confidence to the economy and to the financial system whenever he steps up all of us believe in him so much so I think it would be great if he was able to be helpful during this period and get a great return for Berkshire shareholders involved with conversations on these things are there deals that he saw and passed up on you know maybe we'll get a little color into some of that today I'm hoping that you know maybe that's why there's so many people that are here today too John we're going to welcome our television audience in in just a second but we want you to stay with us and I'm doing this because literally the TV clicked so I'm just hold your thought for just a second we want to make sure we are welcoming our audience in fact you're going to hear a bell in just a second yeah ding ding ding there it goes that sound that you're hearing right now me doing ding ding ding it means that it's 10 a.m eastern time and that means that it is time to welcome our television audience as well we are again at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting and uh yeah okay want to welcome our television audience here and around the world I'm Becky quick I'm here with Mike santoli and this is our live all-day coverage of the 2023 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting we are just 15 minutes away from the start of the action I want to get back to our conversation with John Rogers he's the chairman the co-ceo and the co and the CIO of aerial Investments and for everybody on television this is a conversation we've been having with our streaming audience at cnbc.com so let's just pick it up with where we left off John you were just talking about how if you saw Buffett step in and do some sort of a deal whether it be in the banking system whether it be something that kind of showed some confidence in the system that would mean a big deal for investors everywhere I think it would be he is so revered as we know around the world and I know that the by the Administration has been talking with him and I know you know other leaders are and you can bet that he's the First Call of Many of the major banking Giants on Wall Street to make sure they're getting his best advice and including him in these important conversations it's probably also worth keeping in mind that what he says about his take on whether in fact the banking system is sound whether whether the market is over overshooting and it's uh attack on some of these Regional Bank valuations it's worth listening to as well if he thinks the FED has it right we have this deposit backstop facility and you know let's keep in mind one of the reasons that the bank stocks are going down is consumers are in great shape they got a lot of cheap mortgages unprofitable for the banks they're looking at five percent money market yields they can move their cash there so it's it's it'll be interesting to hear whether he thinks it's an economic risk or it's just kind of a sector that's upside down for the moment well as you know he's such a long-term investor and I think he's going to uh you believe as he always talks about on at the annual meeting about how last century all the problems that confronted our country we always resolve him our capitalist democracy is the best system ever invented so this crisis will pass also I also noticed when I love watching CNBC in the morning when you have those special boxes showing returns like now even showing them Regional Banks how they're doing that's a sign that you're getting toward a period where you know six months from now that'll be a old forgotten story and we'll be on to something new but I love seeing that because it gives you a sense of what's important today John you our long-term investor too you're a value investor you don't often get swayed by things that are happening in the immediate but I have to think that some of the things you've seen recently have been enough to make you sit up and take notice is there anything you've changed in the portfolio as a result of the potential credit crunch as the result of just watching money move quickly out of places does it change your mind or change your investors thesis at all for the short term the only thing that sometimes happens like right now the housing the markets have been very weak higher interest rates have been Troublesome and problematic for the Housing Industry so we've been leaning in in some of the suppliers to the Housing Industry some of our favorites like Leslie's pools for example and residio and people that are creating products for the Housing Industry we think it's been overdone and there's real Bargains there you know there's been a lot of commentary and to some degree a bit of angst about how uh narrow the index performance has been at least recently for times this year we talked about Apple's performance a huge sway on the index is a handful of stocks really carrying the S P 500 where does that leave you as somebody who looks you know for smaller and and less expensive less popular stocks at the moment you know you know I've been fishing in the small and mid-cap Value World for 40 years and I really think there's more opportunity than ever there's these orphan stocks neglected stocks and no one's looking at because they've been so focused on these giant great giant companies that have done so well what about Berkshire itself in terms of How It's positioned I mean on the one hand it's kind of Eternal right the way it's structured and who it's managed by but on the other I mean if you look at what's in favor right now you know aside from Apple which is you know 20 of the market value of Berkshire right now uh it's taken it is uh you have you know Consumer Staples exposure you have real Capital assets that people seem to be wanting to have pricing power um and even on the insurance side they're able to actually make a profit interest rates being up perhaps a help to them do you see value in the shares themselves at this level we do you know when Warren makes the decision to buy back stock the way he has he's so conservative and so for him to make that bet it gives you a really great sense that he sees the company as really undervalued and we would agree we think it's a great bargain here today do you have you been buying I own it personally and I was too big for my small and mid cap value uh portfolios at aerial fund but uh I haven't added to it in a while but that's a good suggestion John thank you very much we always enjoy seeing you here and we really appreciate your time this morning John Rogers from aerial Investments all right Berkshire Hathaways 11.6 billion dollar acquisition a year ago of the property and casually ensure Allegheny brought another diverse portfolio of Brands Under The Berkshire umbrella including one of the fastest growing toy makers in the U.S that's Jazz Wares they make all those viral squishmallows and here at the meeting they're actually selling special Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger squish millos this weekend they come in eight inch size and 16 inch versions this is the first time they've ever made squishmallows with a real human space on them we actually caught up with the company CEO and chief commercial officer Judd and Laura zaberski we acquired a company called kelly toys okay and they were making squish Mallows it's been around since 2017 and we were fortunate enough to build the brand once we acquired Kelly toys because the I mean people compare this to things like beanie babies or to the Cabbage Patch Kids where each of these dolls has a story that comes with it um and you guys are holding the special ones you have for this meeting of Warren and Charlie the first time you've ever put a human face on one of this yeah that's the first time so what they worked out pretty good okay but the story lines was that part of it too or did you guys add to that yeah so every squishmallow has their own individual story and when we acquired Kelly toy we saw that they had this almost diamond in the rough they were people were passionate about it it wasn't available everywhere it wasn't available globally and then um the BIOS were always part of it and what made them really special because kids and adults all identified with something in the bio and so Charlie and Warren both got their own bio that represented them as people not just business people but the really interesting individuals they are one of the things that I think is so amazing I mean these are cool plush toys but they're plush toys they're squishy they have become the most popular toy brand in 21 states they beat out Nerf Plato they beat out Nintendo switch and Hot Wheels how does that happen with the plush and have you guys been surprised by how they've taken off of course yes it struck a nerve during covet um it was this palliative type of feel so people that were sitting at home they bought more and more squish mouths and they fell in love with the product we're the number one best-selling toy in the US and in many many markets and I think what's interesting about it is our demographic it's not just kids it's adults it's grown women it we did a squish Squad tour and we went to major cities and we looked at the line and we said wow there's not that many children in the line and that's the interesting part people find it emotionally supportive [Music] um and that was a big surprise to us yeah people in their 50s are buying our squish Mellows wow that that's very unusual in the greatest and when you found out you were being acquired by Berkshire Hathaway your thought was wow wow and and what's happening uh dream come true yeah if you would have asked us 26 years ago if this would ever ever happen we would say no way but anything's possible in America well the interesting part is Berkshire didn't keep all the companies I think there were some they kind of got rid of they saw you guys and they chose to keep you which we were you know we I remember last year we were watching we knew the transaction was happening we watched the annual shareholders meeting and we said are we going to be there next year well in fact um I think they probably are going to be here next year I think the question is how much of the floor space they're going to get to negotiate because those have been hot cells yeah they do um we weren't the only ones who caught up with them though we were actually there a little later when Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger came by to visit the Jazz Wares Booth right here in the exhibition Hall and here's a funny coincidence for you both of them both Laura and Judd were lawyers before they had this career that's something they had in common with Charlie Munger too and by the way um they were sick of it too they wanted a job that was a little more fun did you know they're both reformed lawyers yes they both started out as lawyers well I'm ready to see a reform lawyer every time going through purchase orders yes Charlie I would like to see about 90 of the lawyers being reported this is a pinch me moment for us because we remember you know Judd started the company by himself no financing no money no backing and just did it and worked hard and of course we had many bumps in the road many many and it makes it that much sweeter and we appreciate it and we never forget how hard it was and we're much smarter today than we were yesterday I learned a lot I'm glad you were part of alligators you can catch more of our interview with Judd and Laura zaberski of jazz Wares and some other sounds from inside the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting in a special series of cnbc's daily podcast it's called squawk pod and you can just scan the QR code on your screen to go ahead and follow squawkpod you can check it out and listen anytime all right well joining us now is the CEO of Benjamin Moore Dan Calkins Benjamin Moore has been part of the Berkshire portfolio for more than 20 years Dan uh good to have you great to be back I hope you're enjoying the weekend so far um eventful few years since you've been running the business yes uh for Berkshire for at Benjamin Moore uh housing boom in conjunction with the pandemic then a little a downturn in in home related investment uh and Improvement where do things stand right now we got the inflationary pressures you've had to kind of deal with and and pass through so what's your kind of snapshot of the business right now well we're in a great spot we're actually celebrating our 140th anniversary this year at Benjamin Moore so we've been through Cycles like this before obviously we'll be through this cycle but it has been uh what we call Benjamin Moore Chasing The New Normal because we had explosive growth in 20 and 21 took a little bit of a step back in the fourth quarter last year got off to a slow start this year but at the end of March we start to see light we're going into the paint season and people people are seeing starting to paint again and we're seeing that in our numbers on a regular basis obviously Big Driver for us is housing turnover and with interest rates High people not moving as much that has an impact on our business so as as mortgage rates hopefully start to come down we'll see more active moving and that drives to more sales for us and and just fixing things up when you cut a paint we can't or we can't move so yeah exactly yeah you'll have people doing some remodeling if they're not going anywhere but the Big Driver is the churn somebody moves they pay every room every room and in terms of supply chain I mean Paint and Coatings were particularly dramatically impacted yes you know during the the pandemic with a lot of the components there short supply where does it sit right now and if you retain pricing I was just looking in aggregate in the in the quarterly report that you know there has been some margins Queens across the building products uh businesses in total which is not suspicious right no we we definitely felt that we're in a good spot now um early last year we had about 65 days of inventory on end our historical average is about 95 days on hand I'm happy to say at the end of March we're at 96 days on hand so we're back to our historical Norms from an inventory perspective we have been able to take pricing over both 21 and 22. so uh while we've felt some of the pressure and compression last year that's evening out now we're recognizing the pricing we took last year in our sales this year so things are good and so that implies that you haven't seen consumers sort of trading down or anything like that when it comes to pain yeah no we have we have some particularly on the DIY side we've seen some of our product mix shift from some of our more premium products to more of our mid-range products uh but we have a full assortment full of portfolio that can meet all those price points that are out there and so we're we're seeing some of that happening right now and with margin shrinks when somebody trades down how much does it's maybe six seven points on from a you know premium product to more of a commercial type product but we have healthy margins at Benjamin Moore we have one of the things Warren life's best about Benjamin Moore is that premium position we carry you know there there's a big picture uh sort of long-term structural bullish story about home ownership actually homeownership rates uh ticking higher still even through this tough period of the economy and this demographic wave that's washing over but how are you thinking about you know expansion plans your ability to capture a lot of that yeah so we have been growing and expanding banding not just here in North America we've been very aggressive particularly in the UK and then moving into Western Europe which is still a small part of our business but we haven't felt the impact over there because it's New Territory for us so we have explosive growth going on over there right now um very exciting and then here long term you know you to your point about families being formed that's happening with this generation that's coming into the housing market and we just think this is a blip through this period of time and as that changes we're prepared to to service what we need to guys if you take a look you'll see this is live footage Warren Buffett is making his way out to the stage right now Charlie Munger will be joining him as well that means they're getting about to the end of the movie they have a long movie 45 minute movie that they show to the shareholders that's what they're seeing right now and there you see Charlie Munger as well so they're being taken out the stage that means things are about to kick off there so I'm going to take my lead that also means you need you have a place to go okay Mike thank you I'll see you back in just a little bit thanks so much thank you all right well Insurance of course one of the big story lines in berkshire's earnings this morning joining me now to discuss is evercore's David modematan he has got a buy rating by ratings on the likes of Travelers Progressive and Chubb uh uh from evercore isi and uh and Dave thanks for joining us uh this morning we were just talking about how over the first quarter berkshire's Insurance businesses specifically Geico did make some moves on pricing uh kind of fattened up the margins reducing advertising spend uh it seems like maybe an industry-wide Trend but what's been happening overall in the competitive uh landscape when it comes to those Insurance lines yeah thanks for having me um so you are seeing just a massive hard Market in the personal auto insurance space and Geico has actually taken you know fairly aggressive action on that front um and you can see that you know the focus on profitability is really coming through in in these results where their policies enforce shrank 13 and you know that's partly because you know there are premium per policy which is a good proxy for their price increases you know is up 15 uh which is you know among the highest that I've seen you know Allstate was up 16 Progressive was up you know close to that level so the entire industry is Raising price um for guy for Geico it looks like they've actually seen you know the their units come down quite a bit and that's resulted in them having better frequency Dynamics which is you know really help their earnings and you know another thing I've noticed is um you know they really cut their ad spend to really focusing on you know what what people they're underwriting to focus on profitability I appreciate that color uh David that was uh that's great we're going to hear a lot more about that in the Q a in the shareholder meeting and we're going to actually get to Becky and Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger for Q a we'll see you back here at 1pm Eastern time when Buffett and Munger break for lunch ahead of their afternoon q a session and the official shareholder meeting they are taking the stage uh right now as you can see and we go there live morning good morning and thanks for coming I love it Charlie loves it we're glad to have you here we're going to make this this uh preliminary before the question is very short because we want to get in at least 60 Questions half divided by the the audience outside this Arena and half from you so I would just like to get right to the to the directors and the earnings that have been put up on the uh on our webpage this morning but we'll cover those very fast and we'll get to the questions now I when I woke up this morning I realized that we had a competitive broadcast going out uh somewhere in the UK and and they were they were celebrating a King Charles and we've got our own King Charles here today [Applause] and next to him we have Greg Abel we was in charge of all the operations except for insurance next [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and next to Greg we have uh a man I ran into a 1986 and has made us look good ever since we have the man in charge of insurance Ajit Jane Jaden and now we have our our directors here in front and if they would just stand briefly and then I'll go on to the next one and and uh they're all here today first of all doing alphabetically there's Howard Buffett there's Suzy Buffett there's Steve Burke Ken Chenal Chris Davis Sue Decker Charlotte Diamond Tom Murphy Jr Ron Olsen Wally Weiss and Merle Whitburn that's as good as you can get and there's one other person I would like to mention before we get onto the earnings that were put on the uh in the press release this morning and uh uh that's uh uh well let's see who we have here we've got this is hard to believe can you imagine a name Melissa Shapiro Shapiro and she was uh Melissa Shapiro Joseph married another Shapiro and she put this whole thing together with no help from me no help from Charlie and a lot of help from the people of the other room Melissa yeah it's very easy if you can remember her second name you can remember her third name so Melissa shabiro Shapiro and with that I would like to next move on to the earnings and a couple small slides that that explain what we're all about and then we're going to get to the Q a and uh the slide is up behind me yeah there it is we reported in the first quarter operating earnings a little over 8 billion and when we talk about operating earnings we're basically referring to the earnings of Berkshire Hathaway as generally well as required under gaap excluding however capital gains both realized and unrealized there's a few other very minor items but basically we expect to make capital gains over time why would we own the stocks otherwise uh doesn't always work out but overall it works out pretty well over time but in any day any quarter any year even occasionally over a five-year period uh the stock prices move around capriciously now we own a lot of other businesses we consider those stocks businesses we own a lot of other businesses where they get Consolidated and they don't move around in value now if we had a little bit of Burlington stock outstanding if we had a little bit of the energy stock trading those stocks would move around a lot but the businesses are what count so the operating earnings as you'll see in the first quarter came in at about 8 billion and I would say that in the general economy the feedback we get is that uh I would say perhaps the majority of our businesses will actually report lower earnings this year than last year the in various degrees in the last six months or so at various times uh the the businesses have left the incredible period which is about as extraordinaries I've seen in business since World War II uh with the government would pour out a lot of money to people who couldn't get Goods it was more extreme in World War II but this was extreme this time and it was just a question of getting Goods the deliverer and people bought and they didn't wait for sales and if you couldn't sell them one thing they would put another thing in their backlog it was an extraordinary period and that period uh has ended it hasn't ended with as you know it isn't that employment's fault or off a cliff or anything in the least but but uh it is a different climate than it was six months ago and and a number of our managers uh were surprised some of them had too much inventory on order and then all of a sudden it got delivered and people weren't in the same frame of mind as earlier and now we'll start having sales at places where we didn't need to have sales before but uh despite the fact that this year I think in general will be slower than last year we actually are situated so that I would expect and believe me when I say accept expect it's nothing is sure nothing sure tomorrow nothing sure next year and nothing is ever sure either in markets or in business forecasts or anything else and we don't pay much attention to markets or forecasts unless the markets happen to offer something interesting to do but nevertheless we are positioned in two respects as you'll see from from this uh first report our investment income is going to be a lot larger uh this year than last year and that's that's built in I mean we have as you'll see in a minute we've had 125 billion or so and very short term investments and and believe it or not uh not that long ago we were getting four basis points which is next to nothing on that 100 125 billion which means we were getting 50 million a year and now the same money the other just day or day before yesterday we actually bought because of some of the funny twist in the market because of doubts about the deficit ceiling of the debt ceiling uh we bought three billion of bills of the 590 that's 5.9 there's a 5.92 bond equivalent yield so we will have what produced us not that long ago on a 12-month basis was producing 50 million a year producing uh something in the area of 5 billion here so we're in a position where the investment income is essentially well it is certain to increase quite a bit and insurance underwriting is not it uh it does not correlate with business activity it depends on things like hurricanes and earthquakes and and other events so on a prospective basis on a probability basis we're likely to have a a better year uh this year in Insurance underwriting than we had last year uh it just isn't affected by what you might call the business cycle or uh what applies to generally an industry detailing you name it uh so I would expect and one massive earthquake or one one hurricane that came into just the wrong place uh would can affect that prediction but on a probabilistic basis our insurance looks better this year so if you get two of those two of the elements there of our main office of earnings that look like they will swing in our Direction I would expect but I can't promise that our operating and earnings will be greater than last year and if we'll move to the second slide uh I give you those operating earnings figures just to give you a overview of what has happened uh since the pandemic started and off of the year the yearbook before as a base and we retain all our earnings as you know so if we're retaining 30 or 35 billion or whatever but maybe a year you should expect more operating earnings over time I mean this this number should be significantly higher five or ten or fifteen years from now because we have the advantage of retaining earnings and that's what got us to these figures because they were essentially nothing when we started and they got there by retaining earnings and we'll keep retaining earnings so it's no great Triumph if these numbers move up and what we hope is that they move up at a reasonable rate historically they moved up at an unreasonable rate sometimes but we're working with a much smaller sums then and that can't be repeated with our present Capital base because I note there I believe it's on this slide let's take a look uh now that'll be see it's on the while on the on the next on the next place paid and let's move to the next slide we showed that we had on March 31st now 500 and was it five hundred and four billion of Gap net worth now what might surprise you is that there's no other company in the United States no other company that has a number that is that large now that isn't because we've got the most valuable company in the United States other companies have used their money to repurchase shares they could have accumulated 504 billion in gap but basically we have more under Gap accounting now than any other company in the U.S and of course if you measure return on on Equity that becomes a very big number to increase at a rapid rate but we hope to do so uh not a rapid rate additional rate um and right below that you see something called float and float is money that uh is left in our hands uh somewhat Akin but very importantly different than a bank deposit but it uh you have to pay interest to get a bank deposit and you have to pay more interest these days and you have to run a bank and do a lot of things and basically this is money that represents unpaid losses at this time you get paid in advance in insurance so what shows up as a net liability on our balance sheet is gives us funds uh do exercise with an amount of discretion that no other insurance company that I know of in the world enjoys just because we have so much net worth and our float now comes to 165 billion and the man sitting on the far left is responsible for moving that number up from a pittance in 1986 to this incredible figure which in most years practically all years hasn't cost us anything so it's like having a bank with no employees no interest and no ability to withdraw the money in a hurry that we have working for us and it's a very valuable asset that uh that shows up as a liability and uh Ajit is responsible for building up this treasure uh which has done been done by out competing insurance companies all over the world and then now a number of our insurance companies in turn are run by talented managers who contributed one way or another uh start with Geico the beginning of my career and the uh that float if you think about it just think of a balance sheet you've got liabilities here and you got assets over here and and the liability side finances the asset side is very simple and stockholders Equity finances it long-term debt finances and so on but stockholders Equity is very expensive in a real sense long-term debt has been cheap for a while but it can get expensive and it can also become new eventually and it and it may not be available uh but float is another item which shows it's a liability but hasn't cost us anything and it it can't disappear in a hurry and it finances the asset side in the same way a stockholders equity and nobody else thinks of it much that way but but we've always thought of it that way and it's built up over time so uh I show at the bottom what's happened with cash and treasury bills through March 31st and I will tell you that the in the month of April we probably added about seven billion dollars to that factor now part of that is because we didn't buy as much stock because that reduces reduces cash and treasury bills we bought about 400 million dollars worth of stock in the month of April that's that's a minus uh in terms of cash available and uh uh we we however sold not some stock which produced maybe four billion and of course we had operating earnings probably two and a half billion or something in that area and my guess is we've probably increased our cash and treasury bills uh six and seven billion in the month and uh I just want to give you a feel for how the cash flows at Berkshire and then if we move to the final I think it's the final one next to the last one uh no I I think it is a lot let's see it's the fourth yeah is this we should have the one up there class a equivalent shares outstanding and and uh you'll notice that every year the number of our shares go down so if we own more businesses and the businesses make more money your chair as shareholders as owners a Berkshire increases every year without you laying out any money now you're laying out the uh the alternative which you could receive in dividends but the reason we've gotten to where we are is because we we kept the money we did pay a dividend in 19. 67 10 cents to share it was a terrible mistake and uh I I always tell people that I I'd love for the men's room and the directors voted while he's gone but that isn't true I was there I confessed they uh but we're very invested and has produced the 500 billion plus of shareholders equity in the 30 billion plus of operating earnings and and we'll continue to follow that policy because it makes a great deal of sense and uh with that I think we've taken care of the preliminaries you can study that the 10q is is on the uh on the uh web page and if you have a week or two vacation you could spend it reading the 10q and but that is the essence of Berkshire and with that I will start with Becky quick and and uh we will alternate between Becky and and the audience and her questions have come in from all over the country and I believe you identified the sender and go to it Becky thanks Warren the first question comes in from Randy Jeffs in Irvine California and his question is if Silicon Valley Bank's deposit had not been fully covered what do you think the economic consequences would have been to the nation simply say it would have been catastrophic and that's why they were covered uh and even though the FDIC limiters two hundred and fifty thousand dollars that that's the way the statute reads but that is not the way the us is going to behave uh any more than they're going to let the debt ceiling uh uh cause the world to go into turmoil and uh they uh well they're just I can't imagine anybody in the administration and the Congress and the Federal Reserve whatever it may have been FDIC I can't imagine anybody's saying uh I'd like to be the one on television tomorrow and explain the American public why we're keeping uh uh only two hundred and fifty thousand dollars insured and we're gonna start around every Bank in the country and disrupt the world financial system uh so uh I think it was inevitable Charlie The Amity no I have nothing to add apparently I should mention this now ajeet and Greg will be here in the morning session which ends at noon and so uh it's got questions to direct to them the time to do it is in the first half of the show and and then after lunch that'll just Charlie and I will be back okay area one hi nirav Patel Haverhill Massachusetts Mr Buffett Mr Monger it seems like you found the Sweet Spot between being too conservative and too aggressive as investors do you ever make bad investment decisions because of your emotions and what do you do to try to keep that from happening well we make bad investment decisions uh plenty of times I make more than Charlie because I'm I like to think it's because I make more decisions but probably more batting average is worse but I can't recall anytime in the history of Berkshire the women in an emotional decision that I know the movie had Jamie Lee in there but that that was for Laughs I mean Jamie Jamie Lee she's good but she's not good enough to get me or Charlie to make an emotional decision laughs Charlie I'm sure you have something to add on that well it's a different movie than it is shown in most corporate meetings [Laughter] personal decision no I don't know that's in business we're talking about yeah no you don't want to be a no emotion person in all of your life but you you definitely want to be a no more no emotion person to making an investment or business decision that uh you can argue that that uh uh with it we probably I would say that we 've made an emotional decision perhaps and when a manager has been with us for some period and we haven't we've we we've ignored the fact that perhaps they weren't quite what they were earlier but our businesses are so good that they they've run better sometimes uh when uh well I've talked about West Coast for example the wonderful Louisville it ran on it ran on automatic pilot for a while but I don't think we suffered to buy it but you can argue that if Charlie and I hadn't liked Louie as much as we did we might have spotted a little bit early but I don't think it made any difference in the results would you would you agree with that Charlie yeah yeah we totally with it and I'm glad we behaved the way we did it Wesco by the way we bought the thing for a few tens of millions and it became worth two or three billion yeah that wasn't common in the Savings and Loan businesses you may have noticed they want they really went crazy in that industry and and we had a wonderful guy in Louis and we didn't go crazy yeah we didn't go crazy dumb okay Becky this question comes from Ben Knoll in Minneapolis he says he's a Berkshire shareholder of three decades and he's attended many Berkshire meetings he's here again this year and this is addressed to Ajit and Greg he says last year I asked you about how Geico and BNSF appeared to lose ground to their leading competitors Geico on telematics and BNSF on Precision scheduled railroading Ajit you responded by saying how you expected Geico to make progress in a year or two Greg you spoke about your pride in BNSF but you didn't directly address the threat of precision scheduled railroading will each of you please provide perspective on these competitive challenges and our company's strategies to address them let me in terms of Geico and telematics let me make the observation that Geico has certainly taken the ball by the horns and has made rapid strides in terms of trying to bridge the gap in terms of telematics and its competitors they have now reached a point where on all new business close to 90 percent is has a telematics input to to the pricing decision unfortunately less than half of that is being taken up by the policyholders the other point I want to make is even though we have made improvements in in terms of Bridging the Gap on telematics we still haven't started to realize the true benefit and the real culprit or the bottleneck is technology Geico's technology needs a lot more work than I thought it did it has more than 500 actually more than 600 Legacy systems that don't really talk to each other and we're trying to compress them to no more than 15 16 systems that all talk to each other that's a Monumental Challenge and because of that even though we have made improvements in telematics we still have a long way to go because of Technology [Music] because of that and because of the whole issue more broadly in terms of matching rate to risk Geico is still work in progress I don't know if you any of you had a chance to look at the first quarter results but Geico has had a very good first quarter coming in at a combined ratio of 93 and change which means a margin of six and change uh even though that's very good it's not something we can take to the bank because they're two unusual items that contributed to it firstly we've had what is called prior year Reserve releases we've reduced results for the previous years and that contributed to it and secondly every year the first quarter tends to be a seasonally good quote of auto insurance writers so if you just for those two factors my guess is the end of the year Geico will end up with a combined ratio just south of 100 as opposed to the Target they're shooting for 96. I hope they reached the target of 96 by the end of next year and but instead of getting too excited about it I think it's important to realize that even if we reach 96 it will come at the expense of having lost policy holder there is a trade-off between profitability and growth and clearly we have we're going to emphasize profitability and not growth and that will come at the expense of policyholder so it will not be until two years from now that we'll be back on track fighting the battles on both the profitability and growth front Greg yep moving to BNSF I'll start again by expressing great pride in the BNSF team we have an exceptional group of led by Katie and and her managers that uh show up every day to do great work on on the railroad at the same time they would be the first to acknowledge there's more to be done there uh the specific reference to Precision scheduled railroading the other large railroad Class A uh railroads in the in the U.S follow that and including the two in Canada we're well aware of what they're doing and and obviously pay close attention to their operating Matrix and our team strives every day to be more efficient obviously I would say we balance it with the needs of our customers if I look back to pre-2022 so we look at the three-year period of 2019 2020 2021 the BNSF team made significant progress on their efficiencies and and and delivering overall value back to the shareholders and and to their customers and at the same time maintaining a very safe railroad for our employees so we're making excellent progress that didn't stop last year they made great progress again the reality in 2022 as we did go through a period of time where we had to call it reset the railroad we came out of the pandemic there were the supply challenges we had certain other issue labor issues and other things going on at the port and the reality is our team prioritized getting the railroad back in place for the long term not a short-term focus on hitting certain operating metrics in in 2022 we're well aware of where we were relative to those metrics but the real Focus was to get the railroad reset in a in a safe manner such that we could deliver long-term value and long-term service to our customers and and that's really what we'll continue to see with that team they'll be continual progress there'll be years where it's not as quickly or even we go backwards but over the long term we'll be very uh we'll see exceptional results from from that team and and couldn't be more proud that we have that asset thank you I wouldn't I would just [Applause] well he deserves but both of them deserve Applause the I would like to add one thing [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the uh at Geico .com's uh was ajith's Choice my choice go back to guy at Geico to work on the problem of matching rate to risk which is what insurance is all about and uh he arrived with exquisite timing right before the pandemic broke out all kinds of things changed but Todd is doing a wonderful job at Geico and uh and he works closely uh with the Jeep but because he saw his home and all Morgan comes back here and we we get together on the weekend sometimes too so uh uh that's been a a remarkable com accomplishment under difficult circumstances and he's not all the way home but he's a he's made a very very big change uh in multiple ways Geico and then one other thing I would like to mention there have been a lot of public companies created in the last decade thereabouts in insurance and uh there's none of them that we would like to own and and they always started out in their perspective saying this is a tech company not an insurance company of course we're of course they're in a tech company where everybody's whether they're in insurance or a lot of other places are using the facility but you still have to properly match rate to risk and uh uh that they invariably have reported the huge losses they've eaten up capital but there's been one company that nobody has generally heard of there's only been one that I know of company started in the last 10 years that has been a overwhelming success and that's a company that a g and four people who join with them set to develop a new business it's called Berkshire Hathaway specialty it now has uh what's the float a g coming up to 12 billion yeah we've we've built more slope than probably all these companies combined we've now it it's cost us essentially nothing in terms of an underwriting loss the four people have turned in I don't know 1500 around the world we we took on the whole industry and we brought some unique how and the four people that came and now have like I said 1500 or so worldwide and we brought capital and we brought okay capabilities that really only Berkshire could Supply so it was the it was the combination of of brains and talent and energy and money and no one has really successfully entered this this space plenty of people in the space who didn't like us coming and we did it without it costing us a dime of Entry and it's been unmatched by any of the public companies that went public and people have seen us do it but they can't duplicate it and that's what Vegeta's created and Peter Eastwood has led this group Berkshire Hathaway specially and uh it's just remarkable so anyway with that let's go on yeah give him a hand for that [Music] okay let's go to section two hi Charlie I'm our end I'm Karen here your priorities are right yes I have a questions on AI and Robotics here's my questions as Ai and Robotics continue to advance what do you believe will be the positive and an active impact of this technology on both the stocks markets and society as a whole and are there any specific Industrials and companies that you believe will be most impacted Karen I thank you for asking Charlie that question well if you went into byd's factories in China you would see robotics going in the unbelievable rate so we're gonna see a lot more robotics in the world I am personally skeptical of some of the hype that has gone into artificial intelligence I think old-fashioned intelligence works pretty well thank you [Applause] there won't be a there won't be anything in AI that replaces the gene the state that unqualifyingly they can do amazing things uh uh you know Bill Gates brought me out of out the latest maybe not the latest version but when he thought maybe I could handle which that has to be careful with me in terms of leading me too fast uh and it did it did these remarkable things uh it didn't but it it it couldn't tell jokes well Bill told me that ahead of time and it prepared me and it it just isn't there but you know with things like checking all the legal opinions on you know since the beginning of time and everything and eliminating all the sided I mean it can do all kinds of things and when something can do all kinds of things I get a little bit worried uh and uh because I know we won't be able to uninvent it and uh you know we did invent uh for very very good reason the atom bomb and in World War II and it was you know it was enormously important that we did so but is it good for the next 200 years of the world that that the ability to do so has been Unleashed we didn't have a choice but uh uh when you start something well Einstein said after this has changed everything in the world except how men think and uh I would say the same thing May not not the same thing I don't mean that but I mean they with with AI uh it it can change everything in the world accept it how men think and behave and that's that's a big step to take it's a good question and it's the best answer we can give Becky this question comes from Tom Seymour he says the first sentence of a recent Financial Times article read Charlie Munger has warned of a brewing storm in the U.S commercial property Market with American Banks full of what he said were bad loans as property prices fall please elaborate on what's going on in commercial real estate how bad will the losses be and what sectors or geographies look particularly bad I'll just add an addendum from another viewer who wrote in and wanted to know if Berkshire would be more active in commercial real estate as a result thank you well berkshire's never been very important very active in commercial real estate it it works better for taxable investors than it does for corporations tax the way Berkshire is so I I don't anticipate huge effects on Berkshire but I do think that the hollowing out of the downtowns in the United States and elsewhere in the world is going to be quite significant and quite unpleasant I think the country will get through it all right but as they say it will awfully it will often involve a different set of owners yeah in the buildings the buildings don't go away but the owners do well but but most people like to buy with non-recourse and and real estate and and one time I asked Charlie there was some real estate guy we were talking to him and you know how do they decide how much they can a building like this is worth and it's the answer is it's whatever they can borrow without signing their name and if you look at real estate generally you'll understand what the phenomena is happening if you if you remind yourself that that's the attitude of most people that have uh become big in in the real estate business and and uh and it does mean that the lenders are the ones that that the property and of course they don't want the property usually so then the real estate operator comes on negotiating with them and and the banks tend to you know stand and pretend and there's all kinds of activities that arrive out of out of commercial real estate development which occurs on a big big scale but it all has consequences and and I think we're we're about well we are starting to see the consequences of people who could borrow it two and a half percent find out it doesn't work at current rates and they hand it back to somebody that gave them all the money they needed to build it them Charlie's having more experience than really Charlie ought to start in real estate though I mean Charlie Charlie yes it it's difficult I like what we do better well as Charlie once said to me when I was leaving his house a few months ago I was visiting him we talked for a couple of hours and I said to Charlie as I left I just wasn't anybody else in the house and I said except one daughter and I said uh Charlie yellow I'll just keep doing what we've been doing and Charlie said without looking up or pausing a second he said that's all you know how to do Warren yeah he was right too uh station three is it hi uh my name is Dallas I'm from Santa Santa Clara California and my question is to Charlie and and Warren given the rise of disruptive technologies that can improve productivity significantly and AI being one of them how do you envision the future of value investing in this new era and what adaptations or new principles do you think investors should adopt and any recommendations for investors to remain successful in this rapid changing landscape thank you I think value investors are going to have a harder time now that there's so many of them competing first a diminished bunch of opportunities so my advice to Value investors is to get used to making less and Charlie was been telling me the same thing the whole time we've known each other wait wait we get along wonderfully because we are making less yeah well but that's because that mostly I think is because it's larger we were younger we never thought we could manage 508 billion no one or five yeah but I I would argue that uh that uh there's gonna be plenty of opportunities and part of the reason they're going to be plenty of opportunities the the tech doesn't make any difference or any of that I mean if you look at how the world changed in them in the years since 1942 when I've started to say well out of the kid that doesn't know anything about airplanes it doesn't know anybody androgens and cars and doesn't know anything about them electricity and all that but that really isn't the that's not there the world changing doesn't or new things coming along don't take away the opportunities what gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things and it's a and I would say that well the 58 years we've been running Berkshire I would say there's been a great increase uh in the number of people doing dumb things and they do big dumb things and the reason they do it to some extent is because they they can get money from other people so much easier than when we started so you could start 10 or 15 dumb insurance companies in the last 10 years and you passkey-u89dsnakj8 could become rich uh if you were a Droid at it whether the business exceeded it or not and the underwriters got paid and the lawyers got paid and that creates if that's not on a large scale which it couldn't be done what 58 years ago you couldn't get the money to do some of the dumb things that we wanted to do fortunately uh and uh so I know I think that investing has disappeared so much from this huge capitalistic Market that anybody can play in but the big money is in selling other people ideas it isn't outperforming in outperforming and I think that I think if you don't run too much money which we do but if you're running small amounts of money I think I think the opportunities will be greater but then Charlie and I have always differed on this subject he he likes to tell me how gloomy the world lives and and I I like to tell them we'll find something and and so far we've both been kind of right [Music] so much money now in the hands of so many smart people all trying to outsmart one another and not promote one another getting more money out of other people and it's a radically different world from the world we started in I suppose it will have its opportunities but it's also going to have some unpleasant episodes but they're trying to outsmart each other in arenas that you don't have to play I mean if you look at that Government Bond Market the field at the treasury ball Market I mean you've got this one bill that's out of line with the others when we bought over three billion of us the other day and and but those are people the world is overwhelmingly short-term focused and if you go to an investor relations call they're all trying to figure out how to fill out a sheet to show the earnings for the year and the management is interested in feeding them expectations that will slightly be beaten I mean that that is the world that's made to order for anybody that's trying to think about what you do that should work over five or ten or Twenty Years and uh I I just think that I would love to be born today and go out with not too much money and hopefully turn it into a lot of money but and surely would too actually just like he would find something to do I will just guarantee you uh and it wouldn't be exactly the same as before but he would have a big big pile I would not like the thrill of losing my big pile into a small pot but we make my big piles is the Way It Is Well I like we agree on that incidentally okay we do you're one of the most extreme lovers of the big pile Becky this question is for both Warren and a g it comes from Jason ploner in Livingston New Jersey he says in 2016 you entered it into a very unique transaction with AIG where you assumed up to 20 billion dollars of liabilities in exchange for about 10 billion dollars up front can you please provide us with an update on this transaction in light of the increase in interest rates and then in Tokyo just a few weeks ago you talked about the risks of banks with assets that were susceptible to Rising interest rates any insight as to how Berkshire liabilities are susceptible to duration would be appreciated is that a direction to ajita or me or what both okay let me introduce it my one thing and well but Ajit is the key to this she's the one to put the deal together but we got handed 10 billion we'll say uh uh and but we weren't restricted to putting that into in the bonds uh so what the exact interest rate interest rates affect us to some degree maybe in terms of the terms uh of the deal we did with AIG or anybody we would do a similar deal with like that but we don't have we don't have to put it in matching bonds or anything of the sort it goes into a general pool of assets which we manage in the assets you know well the liquid assets now are 130 billion plus and that but it goes and so it you know it it it is not set aside in some little compartment like people like to think uh now any any other insurance no other insurance company could do it but they can't think that way uh they aren't even used to thinking that way but they can't think that way because they don't have our our balance sheet we account for 26 or something like that of the net worth of all property casualty companies in the United States uh so uh so far uh the payments that we have had to make have run modestly and a Jeep will correct me on this if I'm wrong because he paid a lot of attention over the the amount we have had to pay has runs slightly below the amount we anticipated having to pay in terms of our share of the losses uh but it served aig's purposes it came to us with where we are in a unique position there's nobody else that was able to write that just like when when we took on the Lloyds I mean Lloyd's said there was no choice other than Berkshire Hathaway when they they essentially resuscitated uh their Market by laying off a lot of liabilities on on Berkshire Hathaway so um we won't see those deals very often if if they're for 500 million or something like that somebody else will go in there and offer more money and everybody's looking for money in Wall Street but if they start talking with the deal like the AIG deal there isn't any other stop now uh correct me on all my numbers there Jade no um one way to look at how the deal is performing since we did the deal is at the point we in time when we did the deal we had made certain projections of how much we will pay out each year and what we do is Monitor what the actual payments are since the Inception of the deal and how does that compare with what we expected to pay out as Warren mentioned these two numbers are very close to each other more specifically the actual payouts are 96 percent of what we had projected to pay out at this point in time which is good but not great we are still ahead of the curve if we do end up paying out less than what we projected Not only would we have borrowed money at a very attractive rate meaning less than four percent significantly less than four percent in addition to that we would have made a fee which in 1990 which in 2015 dollars would be a million dollars so if we would have borrowed money at less than four percent and we would have made a million dollar fee which is slightly more than what we were expecting to do so net net we're very happy with the deal we're happy we did it but the game is not over the taught liabilities they're coming down the pike every second day so I'm cautiously optimistic that the deal will work out better than what we expected it to work out a really interesting thing is that in within Berkshire the Casualty Insurance companies have four times as much stockholder Capital between behind each dollar of Premium volume four times normal and of course we see the big deals who would you trust if you had a big liability you wanted to dump on somebody and we have 25 or billion or more coming in from things other than insurance uncorrelated to Insurance every year with no obligations we don't pay dividends if you paid evidence and you know and you cut your dividend try going around trying to write insurance the next day I mean it's a business where the people are counting on you to pay and when we take that 10 billion we don't agree to put it in five-year bonds and 10-year bonds we don't even think that way and the people who do business with us know that they have somebody like nobody else on those and it's going to be able to pay 10 billion you know it's no matter what happens to the economy uh so it's not only the presence of enormous strength in the insurance companies it's the fact we got all these earnings that essentially come in every month and we don't have we don't have a lot of debt I mean we we have debt at the railroad and the energy level but but in terms of the rest of the operation uh uh and we don't guarantee that debt but but it's probably what uh and it's there just isn't another Berkshire and uh and the Jeep recognizes that when he's negotiating so does the other party if sums are big enough there's all kinds of people that love to get 500 million or 300 million and they'll and they can they may think in terms of lending it out because that's what their insurance companies can do at a somewhat higher rate but that is not a game we play in and we don't have any interest in playing okay station four hello I'm Marvin Blum an estate planning lawyer from Fort Worth Texas home to many of your companies in fact Warren I met you at the memorial for our beloved Paul Andrews who was manager of TTI I'd like to get your thoughts on a widespread problem in the world of Estate Planning and that's the failure of most parents to prepare the Next Generation for the inheritance coming their way in particular if the estate includes a family business most parents fail to do business succession planning to plan for who will run the business on the day when not if the founder is no longer there to run it the kids aren't prepared unlike uh King Charles the the other King Charles not King Charlie Munger who has been preparing for his job as king of England now for more than 70 years I sometimes describe the situation like this picture a football game at one end of the field is a quarterback he has great skills he throws a beautiful pass to the other end of the field and at the other end of the field are the receivers they've never been to a practice they don't know the rules of the game they don't know how to work together as a team they're Clueless so the quarterback is the patriarch and The Matriarch the football is the inheritance or the family business and the receivers are the kids that they're going to catch the football and go score a touchdown probably only around 10 percent I've got the picture um [Applause] the I probably observed as many just because of my age and to some extent because of things like the giving places I probably observed as many particularly wealthy families the problems and they all are again very particular to the family and and uh in my family I do not sign a will until my three children have read it understand it and made suggestions now my children are in their 60s and that would not have been a great one success if I'd done the same thing as their 20s it depends on the Family it depends on how the kids feel about each other there's all kinds of things depends on the kind of business you have so there's a there's a thousand variables but I do think that it's if the children are grown and when the will is read to them it's the first they've heard about what the deceased thought about things the parents have made a terrible mistake and uh people people who well I've run into all kinds of situations and some people don't tell their children anything and some of them try and get them to vendor their will by using their their own personal will they make a million mistakes and that's when you don't get to correct uh you know certainly in my well Charlie's had a lot of experience too well at Berkshire we have a simple problem of uh estate planning just hold the goddamn stock [Applause] I mean that you know I don't think it necessarily I don't know necessarily whether if you have billions of dollars you want to leave it to your all your children I mean that's something that's another question but if you go to places somewhere I just as soon as Berkshire stock is down oh you're solving the investment problems yeah but you've got the personal problem of the fact that when they were four one of the kids pulled the other kids uh cat's tail or something like that I mean you're dealing with human beings and the biggest thing you want is you want you want your children to get along I mean they want that all through your life and the estate isn't the only place where you can mess that up but the it's the place where you it's a very easy I mean I know a number of cases where the people did not know what was in the will whether we're human's involved and you know within about 15 minutes each one of them had a lawyer and you know they don't get a long sense of it it's it's a it's important to handle it right and uh uh it's important if you want your kids to have a certain value with certain values it's important that you live those values it's important that you talk about it to them or they're going they're learning from you from the day they're born what you're really like and uh don't think that a cleverly drawn will will substitute for your own behavior in teaching your kids the values you hope that they will have and then your will should be in conjunction with that it should start expressing and they grow it's older and then they they learn to they they learn to pass along their values in connection with the size of the state if there's Family Farms it's one thing if it's a bunch of marketable Securities is something else but I know in one instance by a particularly Rich fellow that once a year you get his kids together and have a dinner and do all kinds of things to get them to sign their income tax returns in blank because they didn't want them to know how much money they had and everything well if that that isn't going to work I mean I don't know why necessarily real words with him but uh if you want you know about Charlie and I've said it you know if you want to figure out how you want to live your life you you write your obituary in reverse engineer I mean you know and uh and Paul Andrews incidentally who you mentioned that TTI lived as great a life as anybody I've known and uh he he thought about these problems and he came to me he was 61 I think had all the money Way Beyond what he needed didn't care about he'd like to give it to give it to people he had all kinds of good things he wanted to do and he said for a year I've been worried about my business TTI and he said I've got all the money I need the families get all the money that I need but what do I do with the business these people have that helped me throughout my life and he says I can sell it to a competitor and if I sold it to a competitor they'd fire my people and keep their people when they put it together and if I if I sell it to a private Equity Firm or something they'll they'll be figuring their access strategy as they sign the sign the papers and he said so I've been thinking about a year and he said it isn't that you're such a great guy he says it's just you're the only one left and we bought it and we lived happily ever after and uh that was a man that knew what life was about so with that let's go on to uh Becky thank you this question comes from Don glickstein in Seattle he says Warren has criticized Norfolk Southern's handling of its train derailment yet has been silent about BNSF bnsf's conduct a federal judge ruled in March that BNSF intentionally and illegally violated an easement agreement on tribal land in Washington state by transporting long trains of crude oil the same month the judge made his ruling a BNSF Train derailed on tribal lands spilling oil in an environmentally sensitive area what is Warren doing to ensure that BNSF and other Berkshire subsidiaries fulfilled their ethical responsibilities he says he's been a Berkshire owner for more than two decades and he's concerned that Berkshire has no systems to identify and dress what he calls reprehensible Behavior at BNSF and other subsidiaries Garden sure so the uh it it is a valid issue that our team obviously has been dealing with at BNSF we did move uh crude across that uh tribal land we had an agreement that allowed us to move X number of of uh units per day and we did breach it we went over it there's uh there was some fundamental breakdowns there in that our team didn't understand the number of of trains that they could move we have had significant discussions with the tribe looking to resolve the issue recognizing uh we obviously been benefited from moving those trains and those type of discussions will continue um I would say there's Lessons Learned there that we have to when we make a commitment understand what that commitment is and and live by it or don't assume um we can just move our trains as we wish or the the cargo as we wish we have to respect those agreements so there's a there's been a moment learned there but at the same time we've taken it very seriously and attempted to reach a resolution there and at some point I I hope we do come to a true resolution that's fair both to the tribe and to BNSF on the derailment side we did have a an issue around the track derailed we worked very closely with the tribe to mitigate that issue instantly where at least over a very reasonable period of time they were very responsive our team was very responsive and there were really no long-term environmental impacts to to that uh to that spill and as our teams highlighted in other comments obviously derailments do occur in the industry we take them incredibly serious they're not all hazardous but irrespective of that we're constantly looking at how do we prevent them how do we detect them when we potentially have one that's going to occur and what do we do with our trades and then ultimately it comes down to responding properly because they will occur and I think we have an incredibly dedicated team that's always ready to respond to the communities uh they're impacting there are derailments how many how many a year yeah well there's a a thousand plus in the industry the the yeah yeah it's you start hauling right and we're a common carrier we and we take heavy very heavy Freight and we take them at 100 degrees when it's the weather and it's we take it to zero and and we go around curves and we have grades and uh even a one percent grade if you're going down down a hill with I don't know how much weight behind you I mean there's a lot of railroading is not an easy business and of course the systems were designed you know in the and basically in the in the late 1800s amid the late 1800s and we have 22 000 I think it is miles of track and that doesn't count sightings and some other things it is not an easy business we'll make mistakes our job we're not making a mistake because we have a derailment you're gonna we will have the derailments 10 and 20 years or 30 years from now I mean that but we and we have to carry certain products we wish we didn't have to carry we're a common carrier do we like carrying chlorine and ammonia and all no but they're going to move from one place to another in this society and we are a common carrier and uh we load them and uh if they select our railroad but we are better than we used to be but we got a long way to go was that fair enough statement absolutely yeah okay station five hi Mr Warren and Miss Manga my name is from China company and first of all I'm so excited and very honored to be here today and my question is with more and more people focusing on environmental competition protection and the government supporting the new energy industry as well so what are your thoughts on the continued development of new energy how made the new energy firm achieve better development in future I think it's the best answer that because he since we bought a company called Mid-American but now called Berkshire Hathaway energy but he's been talking about a yearly preparing reports hoping that we can help solve a number of the problems and we probably spent more money than any utility um I would guess in the United States and uh and we've just scratched the surface but it is not easy when you cross state lines I mean it's uh uh you have different jurisdictions and we should this country should be ahead of word is in terms of transmission and uh we have been the biggest factor in helping that uh but why don't you tell them a little bit about it sure things weren't so there's no question there's an energy transformation going on around the globe and and as Warren touched on in the U.S and in some ways I would hope in here in the U.S it would be um we'd at least have a a clear plan Across the Nation as to how to uh approach that but the reality is it is state by state uh with some exceptions but so as a result when you think of Berkshire Hathaway energy we we own uh three uh U.S utilities there and and they'll participate in multiple States but they're developing plans state by state and then trying to integrate them across the the various States the the opportunities are significant because there is a transformation going on uh We've outlined our goal on on where we're going relative to carbon at bhe where they'll buy 20 30 reduce their carbon footprint by uh 50 relative to 2005 so that's the Paris Accord and the standard they want to hold the the utility industry or the utility companies too and and we're well on that path but to achieve it is a true Journey uh I've often talked to Warren when we bought Pacific warp back in the mid 2000s we immediately recognized uh to build a lot of renewable energy like we've been doing in the midwest in Iowa but that was basically in a single stay eight now Pacific Corp were in Six States we started that in the back in the mid 2000s here we are and we laid out a great transmission plan here's how we're going to build it here's how we're gonna uh effectuate it and all the benefits for our customers over that period of time here we are in 2023 and we have a little more than a third of that at the time it was a six billion dollar transmission project today we have a little more than a third of it built and we've spent probably closer to seven billion dollars and it's the right outcome it's still a great outcome for our customers but that transmission you absolutely as part of the transformation you absolutely have to build it to remove to move all that renewable energy and that's sort of the complexity Warren was highlighting it is a uh you you can't just wake up one day and and solve this problem you start with transmission and then you build the resources but at that same same company and if we look at what we're doing across BH G Energy and that energy transformation we have 70 billion dollars of known projects that are really required to properly serve our customers and Achieve that type of energy uh transformation across those utilities and that and that's in the coming next in the coming 10 years so um we have a team that's absolutely up to the challenge they're delivering on their commitments and it's a very uh very good business opportunity for for each of our companies and for our shareholders because as we deploy that Capital we obviously are in a return on Equity of it so um but it will be a long journey it it have it'll happen over an extended period of time and then and the further you get out there the more dependent more dependent upon the uh the evolution of a variety of technologies that are progressing but not there yet so you you've raised a question I want to just take an extra minute on because it's so important and and I don't really know whether our form of government um is ideal at all in terms of solving uh the problem you describe we have solved it one time in World War II we took a country that was semi-lumping along and we found ourselves in a World War and what we did in a World War is we brought a bunch of people to Washington at a dollar a year you know whether it was Sydney Weinberg of Goldman Sachs you just name him and we gave them enormous power to reorient the resources of the United States to face the problem that they faced which was to create a war machine and what they did was they found Henry Kaiser you know and told them to build ships and they went to the Ford Motor Company and said you build thanks and some airplanes and they they reordered the industrial Enterprise of the United States in a way that was unbelievable because they had the power of the federal government and they had the ingenuity of American Business and they had the facilities of American Business and it led to very successful outcome but can we do that in a peacetime where you've got 50 50 states and you'll have to get them to cooperate and you don't have anyone that you can you can issue orders but you can't you can't designate where the capital goes as the other end and you know we try and do it with tax incentives and all that sort of thing but we haven't we haven't created the unity of purpose and the Machinery that worked in World War II were essentially everybody felt that one job was to win the war and we figured out how to use our industrial capacity to uh in fact defeat the Axis powers and uh how do you recreate that uh uh with the present democratic system I I'm not sure I know the answer but I sure know the problem but um and I think that it if you can think of a if you've got an emergency on your hand you really need to re-engineer the engineer Energy System the United States I don't think I don't think you can do it uh without something resembling the Machinery the urgency whatever the capital is there the people are there uh the the objective is obvious and uh uh we just don't seem to be able to do it in a peacetime where where they're used to following a given set of a procedure and uh and you know China's got one country and we've got we've got 50 states and we've got a whole different system of government that that we should be up to the test but so far it hasn't worked but uh so thank you for the question Becky this question comes from Chris freed in Philadelphia he says we know that Greg Abel and Ajit Jain are the next generation of Berkshire leaders who are currently behind Greg and Ajit in their prospective roles respective well that will be the question that they give their well Greg will be have some things extraordinary circumstances but but he's going to succeed me and then he will have be sitting in a position where he needs his equivalent or something close to the corner because he's better at many things than I've been uh he will need that substitute and when the when the question comes word we know ajit's opinion on that uh and but Greg will probably be the one that will make make the final decision I mean it says it was his responsibility and Ajit will give him his best advice and I think the others are very very very high would follow it so but it's not those are not easy questions it isn't like we've everybody talks about the executive bench and all of that sort of thing which is baloney I mean you know it uh they don't have that many people that can run five the largest gap net worth company and all kinds of diverse businesses uh but you don't need five people either and you need a lot of good operating managers and you need somebody at the top that allocates capital and make sure that you've got the right operating manager and we've designed design something where we separate the insurance and the rest of the business and I think it's a very good design but they would not be smart we wouldn't miss Martin name that decision now about the two different different uh areas of the business because a lot can change between now and then and the most likely changes that this job changes Charlie I I got nothing to add we have a lot of good people that have risen and the Berkshires and City areas and there's a reason why our operations have by and large done better than other big conglomerate comedies and one of them is that is that we change managers way less frequently than other people do and that's helped us when Paul Andrews died we know we know who he thought should take over there but there wasn't any reason to to announce that I mean that Paul Anders would I wish he'd lived to be a hundred we had we had one of our managers die not long ago in the how old was he at Karen yeah mid 90s Seymour yeah say more away from the scene and Seymour I wrote him a letter when he was 80 and I said you know I'm about your 80 and I'll write you again when you're 90. and uh I wrote him again one of his 90. he didn't make it to 100 but but he had a terrific uh fellow following him and it really Managed IT jointly to some extent as the years went by but it's Case by case and the main thing to do is have the right person running the whole place okay station six good morning my name is I'm from Miyazaki Japan I was one of the 8 000 employees at Solomon Brothers that you saved I was younger back then I was working at seven World Trade Center I've always always wanted to thank you in person for saving the company it's in police including myself and my family so thank you Mr Buffett thank you and and and thank Derek thank Derek mon who actually had been over in Japan before that and who I met for the first time the day before I put him in and he turned out to it wouldn't have it wouldn't work if Derek hadn't come so whatever you taught him in Japan thank you thank you sir now my question time at the time you have reminded us to not bet against America what do you think are the most important things for U.S to remain strong and on the risk side if the strength of the country is undermined what could be the reasons well we've had we've had a lot of tests I mean we're such a young country you know when you think about Japan and you think about the United States it's just incredible how new we are to the block I mean you know what what are we here 234 years old since since we started that that's that's that's nothing I mean you know Charlie and I combined are two-thirds of people have two-thirds of the life of the country so and I mean it really has I mean we've we've been tested at 46 national elections but and and we made some bad choices we got a Civil War I mean it so the country is that an enormous advantages though in some way because we started with one half of one percent of the world's population in 1790 and we now have something close to 25 percent of the world's GDP and it wasn't because we had some incredible advantage in terms of the line it was nice to have two oceans oceans on each side back when when uh people tried to rule the rule the world by ruling the waves but it you know and we've had good neighbors in Canada and Mexico but it's a miracle and you say how do we keep the good parts of the system while calling out our obvious defects and we do it in a very herky-jerky matter but net the United States it was a better place to live but almost when I was born by a huge Factor I mean I just got a root canal a week ago and I was just thinking I don't know who even invented nobody came but I'm for him you know I mean but in a million ways I mean you can roll you can romanticize about the past but forget it uh it it is it is work but now we do have an atom bomb and we've we wish nuclear power yeah you know we wish the item had never been split but but uh it has been and you can't put it back in the bottle so the challenges are huge our government always looks you know my dad was in Congress back in the 1940s and it looked like a mess then you know it all it was unified by the war to some degree but it was still very partisan now the problem we have I think is that partisanship it seems to be his move toward tribalism and tribalism just doesn't work as well I mean when it gets to tribalism you don't even hear the other side and tribalism can lead to mobs I mean it just it it flows I mean you've seen it all splurious we've seen it to a degree here so we we have to refine in a certain way our democracy as we go along we deal with the world we live in but if I still have a choice of any post to be born in the in the world I'd want to be born in the United States and I'd want to be born today I mean it's a it is a it is a better world than we've ever had and with present-day Communications we can also say associate seem much more how terrible it is in many ways and it's got problems when I was born in 1930 there were two billion people in the world and now there's maybe 7.7 billion and growing and we went Millennium with really no change in population so we and of course we've introduced energy into uh in an incredible way into something where we now have 7.7 billion people using way more energy than they did when I was born when there were two billion people so it's it's an exciting world it's a challenging world and I you know I don't know the solutions on things I do think that we do need to think about different solutions in terms of how we get important problem solved and that we don't kid ourselves that something magic will happen or that everybody will get together and we'll all just cheer and then go away by 2050 or anything it uh and how well we adapt to them we will see I would say so far it doesn't look very promising but then I'm sure that when Lincoln looks at it what was going on in the Civil War didn't look very promising either so I think that the US is capable of doing remarkable things and I think wouldn't surprise me if they do it again Charlotte Charlie May are you well I'm slightly less optimistic than warranty I think the best wrote ahead to human happiness as expect less I think it's going to get I think it's going to get tougher and I think the solution of having a huge proportion of the young and brilliant people all the way into Wealth Management is a crazy development in terms of its natural consequences for American civilization we don't need as many wealth managers as we have you wouldn't but Charlie was born on January 1st 1924. and you'd hate to go back to that one Detroit yes I would and I I I like more wealth managers who were just merely reflecting the fact there's more wealth but we've got I don't like everybody going into wealth management or MIT or something it's I think the world's a little crazy now take your choice okay Becky this question comes from Dennis degennaro as Warren stated in the 2022 annual report Berkshire will always hold a boatload of cash in U.S treasury bills it will also avoid behavior that could result in any uncomfortable cash needs at inconvenient times including Financial panics and unprecedented Insurance losses after Warren passes away his a shares will be converted into B shares and distributed to various foundations these foundations will then sell the shares to fund their causes Warren estimates it will take 12 to 15 years for all his shares to be sold I worry that a corporate Raider like Carol icon or a group will buy up enough of these shares to take control of Berkshire and completely disregard Warren's philosophy of holding a lot of cash in U.S treasury bills and instead be greedy Reckless and highly speculative and ruin berkshire's position as a rock solid Financial Fortress I also worry that changes might be made in how Berkshire subsidiaries are run do Warren and Charlie worry that these things could happen well I think it's fair to say we think about a plenty but I don't I don't I don't I don't worry enormously if we it is true that that uh Greg and the directors will have a honeymoon period for a long time because simply because uh of the boats that will still remain I mean it and and uh but it's true that eventually they won't get judged based on how well our operation fairs versus others now if we don't pay any dividends and in 12 or 15 years you're talking a trillion and a half that it would take to take over and and uh I think if we can't that that limits the group they like to think about how much they can borrow against it it doesn't work when you uh and and some of these there's nobody to come close to doing it themselves and I think that the important thing is that Berkshire regarded the be regarded as a National Asset rather than a national liability we've got to be a plus to the country with our form of operation we certainly have got a record which will then be 12 or 15 years longer done with much more Capital more companies more things will have happened where our hundreds of billions can work its way into the economy in terms of lots of jobs lots of products loss of behavior and it can be compared with other things so I I I think we went out of if we deserved to win out and I think uh I think the odds of that happening are very very very high Charlie well we I don't spend much time worrying about something's going to happen 50 years ago and ever I'm dead I I think you sort of take care of each day's responsibilities pretty well and think ahead as well as you can and you just take the results as they fall so I'm I'm philosophical but I I'm not I'd be spreading unnecessarily okay neither one of us are worried basically uh but we but but we plan we do plan and and you know I've got a model in my mind of what Berkshire has been that model has gotten it's been modified plenty of times over 58 years the one thing I know initially is or very quickly was it shouldn't be a textile company that was that was an important decision and and I mean we've just played the hand as a as it come along and and we made a few really good decisions and we will never make a decision that kills us they only things that are a threat to the planet we don't have any answer for those but we do we keep ourselves in better shape than anybody else that and we just aren't going to have big maturities of debt that come along we aren't going to have uh insurance policies and be can be cashed in that mass and we will sit with the Lord what looks like a huge among the capital and but it is a huge amount of capital but there's a huge amount of earning power there's a huge amount of diversity everything so our business model will be graded and it'll be graded against a lot of a lot of people that we'd like to be graded against so uh I think we're handling something very secure over to the Future and I think we've got the shareholder base like nobody has I mean there isn't anybody in the country that I know of unless they've had a shareholder an employee-owned company prior to going public or something of the sort but but this is the product of you know the 58 years of of regarding the shareholder as the owner of the company but what does that mean that means having happy customers it means being it being means being welcomed by your community rather than having them turn you away it means that the government feels better with you if there's a financial crisis because you're you can provide something that actually the company the country can't under some circumstances and you'll be there and if it may and same time it'll be good for the business uh and we will have crises of one sort or another but if they aren't challenging the planet which worries you in terms of some of the threats that we have learn won't be a plus to the United States and if we're close to the United States Will Will Survive okay station Seven Mr Buffett and Mr Munger thank you for having us this weekend my name is Beau Clayton and I'm from Durham North Carolina one of the reasons that we are all here is that your great storytellers and we carry those stories back home with us can you please share a couple stories that maybe we haven't heard before about Mr Abel and Mr Jane that capture their character and their caliber as leaders [Applause] I'll start out with the Jeep he walked into the office and 1986 and I'd gotten the bright idea of going into the reinsurance business I think in maybe 1969 so I'd stumbled along uh for 17 years and it a wonderful guy that rather uh uh but he also liked certain Brokers and I mean he was running at the traditional wave taco top quality and everything else but but uh but he fell into he he didn't try and change the system he tried to improve the system and to some degree and we just we went nowhere 17 17 years wandering around in the wilderness when I thought I was um I knew we could have something good and then the G came in on a Saturday and uh uh Mike Goldberg and stirred him in I think and Mike deserves to be enshrined and perpetuity act and I talked with him a while I think maybe I was opening the mail on Saturday while I talked with him and and he had absolutely zero experience with with insurance but it actually seen a good bit of how Corporate America operated because it has been a management consulting and after talking with him I I knew I'd struck over and uh so I hired him and gave him the backing of some money uh and we had a very good period in the market almost right away for him to act and and the Jeep uh you know if I had the top pick of 10 Insurance managers in the world I'm I I could take all ten and they wouldn't you can't replace a Jeep and uh we still enjoy talking I don't we don't talk as frequently as he used to but we used to talk about every day but he is he's one of a kind and you know what if they're going to stick around long enough you only need one of a kind Paul Andrews stuck around a TT had all the money in the world every time I talk to him about getting a raise or something of the sort he said we'll talk about that next year I just he was not what you get when you get the top draft picks from the leading Business Schools and I will say this I have never looked at where anybody went to school in terms of of hiring I mean I I just somebody mailed me a resume or something I don't care where they went to school uh uh and it just so happens that that uh actually went to some pretty good schools but he isn't a g because he went to the schools and uh Charlie didn't tell a story or two um how'd you find Louis vincenti Ally well he was there I I but you got to recognize him I asked Louie once how he managed to play first string football at I think Stanford when he only weighed 165 pounds and he said well I said I was pretty quick and he was pretty quick but we have found a lot of people within our companies who were pretty quick it's it's a yeah we had we had one guy that quit at fourth grade didn't in Ben Rosner Am I Wrong oh yeah totally self-educated Ben Rosner knew more about retailing and difficult neighborhoods and anybody and he watched everything in his business like a hawk and he was a he was amazing now there was an example we never found anybody who could do what when Ben died that bill I don't know he left us yeah and you want a story it's kind of interesting because Ben Rosner had a partner Leo Simon and Lisa Leo Simon was uh Moe annenberg's son-in-law and Leo therefore is very very very wealthy and uh and then started with nothing but they they liked each other and one time well before they got in volved in the in the business uh the business we bought but they got the idea of buying a submarine from World War One and taking it to the century of progress or the World's Fair in effect in Chicago I think in 1933 so they bought the submarine for not probably nothing and they figured you know the average guy from Walmart was going to his first World's Fair get a submarine for a quarter or something that they'd pay it so they hauled it from Florida wherever they got they hauled it to Chicago and then they got into Chicago and they're hauling a submarine down the streets of Chicago and it was creating traffic problems like nobody could imagine so a cop came over and he said to Ben he said what do you think you guys are going with a submarine and Ben says he says well he says you'll have to talk to my partner Mr Capone [Laughter] just keep going and that was that was Ben Roger and then Leo Simon died and when he died in 1967 or so uh Ben Rosner kept delivering half thee prophets to his widow who was incredibly Rich of course being no annivers first born born daughter I think I think I think Moe had nine nine girls in a row before Walter came along the tenth I may be lost by one but anyway I went to this fancy apartment and anyway then then kept her in for a half the deal and he had her signed the rent checks just so she would look like she was doing something in this business and she didn't need the money obviously but he just felt he was obligated once his partner Leo died and then she started criticizing him and at that point then went to her his lawyer was her lawyer actually will felsteiner I don't know whatever happened to will but he gave me he gave me a call because Ben wanted to call me because he wanted me to buy it and he wanted me if I bought it he'd be rid of the partners ex-partner's wife and uh and he'd get he had me and Charlie come back and we went to will felsteiner's office and businesses I'll work till the end of the year and that's all but I'll tell you this thing for six million bucks and I had two million in cash and a couple million in real estate and a couple million of operating earnings this is crazy but he fell over he was getting a lousy prize she was taking a half of the a lovely price for half the money so uh uh he looked at me at some point Charlie you described the rest of it again he said I heard here you're the fastest draw in the west he says draw one of the New York lawyer's office yeah and this guy is he's selling he's selling his baby and and he told us he's going to leave it I got Charlie on this side I said if if this guy leaves at the end of the year he can throw away every psychology book that's ever been written I mean it isn't going to happening and so we bought it and we lived happily ever after with Ben and one time he was taking me over to see a property we had in Brooklyn and uh and along the way I said uh Ben I you know I promised you I wouldn't interfere in the business when we started and he knew a butt was coming and he just said Thank You Warren and they're showing him he was a lot of fun we have so many Ben rozen stories but now you've heard one that hasn't been published before okay Becky this question comes from chai gohil he writes this is for a G reinsurance industry is going through one of the hardest pricing environments in the last 15 years Berkshire historically has participated during these stress times when economic returns are very attractive this year it appears Berkshire has not been interested in deploying its resources towards property cat reinsurance despite such strong returns can you elaborate on reasons for not participating despite these returns and your broader view on how you're planning to shape your reinsurance business post-acquisition of Allegheny in terms of Allegheny that's an easy response we look we treat our operating units independent of each other and as far as Allegheny is concerned they have a major presence in the reinsurance business under the brand name of transatlantic re that company will operate the way it's been operating in the past there'll be no change in terms of strategy or management and they will keep doing what they're doing they've been very successful and hopefully they'll keep being successful now in terms of the property CAD business that I have been active in over these last several years you are right that the last 15 years has been a difficult time prices have not been attractive and even though we have had some presence in the property cat business in the last 15 years it really is been minimal uh this December 31st which is a big renewal date for Cattery insurance we were hoping that we would get a few days in the Sun and we'd be able to deploy our capital and be able to write some fairly attractive business as it happened towards the end of December till about the third week of December I was very optimistic that we would get a chance to put several billion dollars on on the books but in the last 10 days of uh December unfortunately a lot of capacity came out of the Woodworks pricing that we were expecting to realize didn't really come and meet our pricing requirements as a result of which January 1 was a big disappointment we did not write as much as we were hoping to write now fast forward to April 1 which is another big renewal date we had a lot of powder dry and we were lucky that we kept the powder dry because April 1 suddenly prices zoomed up again a lot higher than what they were on January 1 and started to look attractive to us so now we have a portfolio that is very heavily exposed to property catastrophe uh to put that in perspective our exposure today is almost 50 percent more than what it was uh five six months ago so you know we I think we have written as much as our capacity will allow us to write we are very happy with what we've written the margins have been healthy the only thing that I want to mention to you is that while the margins have been healthy we have a very unbalanced portfolio what that means is if there's a big hurricane in Florida we will have a very substantial loss as opposed to that if we have a very big loss anywhere other than Florida relative to a competition we will have a much smaller loss net net I'm very happy with the portfolio it's been a lot better it is a lot better than what it's been in the past uh I don't know how long it'll last and of course if the hurricane happens in Florida we could lose across all the units we could lose as much as 15 billion dollars and if there isn't a loss we'll make several billion dollars is profit and LG tell them how long when you call me and said you'd like to expose us to whatever was a couple billion more of of exposure how long I took to say yes yeah uh so the way we think about our exposure is you know in in the property in the insurance operations collectively across the entire company uh given that we have about a little less than 300 billion of capital we think of that as a 55 exposure that we're willing to take on so to complete Warren's story a few weeks ago we had about 13 billion dollars of exposure all across like uh the globe and I called up war and I said we're up to 13 it'll be nice if we could go up to 15 that's a good round number and that was less than a 30 second phone call I think Warren said yes without even listening to what the numbers I hope he calls me again [Laughter] okay station eight hello my name is adal Flores and I've been a shareholder for about 16 years and I'm coming from Guadalajara Mexico my my question is for Warren and Charlie companies have the Eternal dilemma between bought Building Products that can make profits and increase their company competitive position in the best case you can build products that have both characteristics at the same time like Google did but most of the time companies need to choose between short-term profits and long-term defensibility for example Amazon was focused on building their famous Amazon flywheel with limited profits initially in order to abstain obtain stronger Network effects with the hope of getting more defensible profits in the future when you invest you constantly speak about the importance of building competitive modes what advice would you give to CEOs about how to balance this dilemma which is essentially short-term profit versus long-term definitibility thank you well the answer to control your destiny which we've been able to do it uh Berkshire so we have we feel no pressure from Wall Street uh you know we don't have investor calls we don't have to make promises we we get a chance to make our own mistakes and and occasionally find something that that works well but we recognize that the people in this room and people like them uh are the ones we're working for and we're not working for a bunch of people that that care about whether we meet the quarter estimate or anything so we have a freedom uh that we that we get to use and we're interested in men we're interested in owning a wonderful business forever well there aren't very many wonderful businesses but we do learn a lot as we go along we we Charlie and I have often mentioned how we learn so much when we bought C's candy which we did but we learned when we bought Ben Rogers chain of women's dress shops spread all over the the eastern part of the country uh we learned when we tried them getting into the department store business back in 1966 and as the ink was drying on our purchase price we realized we'd done something dumb but we're we're learning all the time how consumers behave I'm not going to be able to learn the technical aspects of businesses but that you know that that be nice if I knew it but but it isn't essential and you know we are obviously uh we've got a business at Apple which is larger than our energy business and we may only own Five Points six or seven percent but our ownership goes up every year and I don't understand the phone at all but I do understand consumer Behavior and I know how people think about whether to buy a second car I know wow they go out to different We Own auto dealerships we own we're learning all the time from all of our businesses how people react to Garanimals versus you know selling them something else and and so cease was a sort of breakthrough but but it just we just keep learning uh as to more about how people behave and how a good business can turn into a bad business and how some good businesses can maintain uh uh their competitive advantage over time and and so um we don't we don't have some formula the worship people we just but we can also tell them in 10 seconds whether it's something of Interest I mean with you know when when uh I get these calls and we want to send decks and all that sort of which is nonsense I mean it uh uh there's a bunch of guys sitting that get paid for drawing up these projections of the future and everything like that if they knew the future you know we don't know the future but we do know certain kinds of businesses we know what the right price is and we know what we think we can project out in terms of consumer Behavior Uh and consumer and threats to a business and and that's what we've been about and that's what we'll continue to about we do get we don't get smarter over time we get we get a little wiser though uh following it over time and and you can do it while sitting in the office with a telephone too which we like Charlie well tell them the story of the Japanese investment that that should be told again that that that's that's a nice story you know well it was pretty simple I mean I you know other back when I started other people were going through Playboy and I was going through Moody so that you know basically and uh uh there's a movie out called Turn every page but which I saw again for the second time a couple of days ago Lizzie got leaving I recommend everybody in this world watch that because I turned every page in the past and uh I did it for thousands and thousands of pages and Moody's and I did it at the Department of Public Utilities in in Boston I did a Dan Newton the insurance department that it just kept turning page as well that that goes on for a while but now we need Big Ideas in order to find things and uh and what was your question Charlie tell them about the Japanese well the Japanese thing was was simple I mean it kind of I like looking at companies every I mean I like looking at figures about companies and and here were five very very substantial companies understandable companies most of them uh maybe all of them we've done business within in a dozen different ways if you go a couple miles from where this place is the our last coal generating plant was built by one of the companies that so here they were they were sitting as a group where they were earning will say 14 percent uh on what we were going to pay to buy them they were paying decent dividends they were going to repurchase shares in some cases they owned a whole bunch of businesses that we could understand as a group although we didn't mean we had deep understanding on anything but we've seen them operate and everything that there wasn't anything to it and at the same time we could take out the currency risk by financing in in the end and that was going to cost us a half of one percent well if you get 14 on one side a half a percent on the other side and you've got money that you know forever and they're doing intelligent things and they're sizable so we just started buying them I didn't even probably tell Greg until maybe six months after we'd gotten going and and then we hit five percent uh in all of them we announced on my birthday and uh at 90th at the we owned over five percent and recently went over for the first time to visit with them and moved more than pleasantly surprised delighted with what we find there and now we own 7.4 percent of them we won't go over 9.9 without their agreeing and we sold another 164 whatever it is uh billion of us again would have done for us if we only had five billion dollars or something and it made 10 billion dollars simply in that way yeah we were the heroes now 10 billion just sort of disappears as it's an Old Dot in person's report but it's fun and it is fun and it is 10 billion dollars and Charlie says it keeps and Charlie says it keeps me out of bars right knocked up about it and I probably talked to Charlie about this app the year after I started but who knows I mean I but I knew he'd like it I mean obviously and and [Music] yeah well not even that quite that much yeah but you know we are four or five billion ahead plus dividends and we've got to carry that's terrific and and you know uh and they welcome us and they should welcome us and but we we love it the way they're operating we're not there to tell them what to do in the least uh uh so we didn't and but we did say we never go over 9.9 and we mean it and then they they know that will be true to our word and I went over there partly to introduce Greg to those people because we're going to be with them 10 20 30 40 years from now and they may occasionally find something that we can do jointly and they look they look forward to doing that we look forward to it and uh in addition we have some other operating businesses in Japan so Greg do you have anything the only thing I would add is that one has one you went over there it was to build the build the trust with these Japanese companies because we do hope there's long-term opportunities but fundamentally as you highlighted uh they're an incredible uh they've been a very good investment I'd also highlight the five meetings we had we're really quite remarkable I mean these companies the culture and the history around it and how proud they are you know there's just moments of learning from them so it was it was just a great experience to to spend really two days with the five companies and an issue that we intended to be 56 billion of Yen that we were issuing and selling turned out to be 164.4 or something like that everything everything's worked so well and as Charlie says it you know it doesn't move 500 billion of net worth that much but this one is you know it will keep adding over the years to the berkshire's value with this one very widespread probably four or five hundred million dollars a year and uh you know we'll just keep looking for more opportunities and and Japan we have bursure is the largest borrower outside of corporate borrower side of Japan that that exists and we didn't said how to be that but it's it's turned out that way and and we're not done I mean it uh you know in terms of what may come along there and uh we have some direct operations there as I mentioned that the uh and we've got some really wonderful Partners working for us and I don't have to do anything [Laughter] okay Becky the next question comes from Ellie Amin Tibet who asks during an episode of investing the Templeton way podcast Professor damodaran who he respects almost as much as Warren and Charlie mentioned that he is not comfortable with positions becoming a large part of his portfolio for example when they reach 25 to 35 percent he mentioned that apple is now 35 percent of berkshire's portfolio and thinks that that is near a danger zone wonders if Warren and Charlie can comment I believe we made one comment first but Charlie will come up with I think he thought it was mine yeah apple is not 35 percent of of Berkshire portfolio bursters portfolio includes the railroad the energy business or animals you name it See's Candy they're all businesses and uh you know the the good thing about Apple is that we we can go up they buying their stocking instead of owning 5.6 percent you know they got down to they got about 15 billion 700 and some million shares outstanding they get down to 15 and a quarter billion without u\n",
